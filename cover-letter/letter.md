As a computer science student with experience in software development, I was really excited to see this posting for the position that you are offering.

I have years of experience in a wide range of environments â€“ from software development, to traditional engineering work, and  even in a teaching role as a math instructor. In my last position at the University of South Florida, I led a small team where I developed models in the Django web framework. There, I had the pleasure of working as both a software consultant and web developer, presenting potential solutions and then implementing them for the Global Center for Hearing & Speech Research group.
Leading a team of undergraduate students with no previous experience in software development in an agile team environment proved to be a fruitful leadership experience, as I had the pleasure of teaching multiple technologies; such as git, gitlab, Django development techniques, and the linux command line. 

That being said, I believe in working for industries that make an impact and that I am passionate for. With my willingness to learn and overall expertise, I am confident that I would make me a fantastic addition to your team.

My resume and personal website will give you a greater understanding of my capabilities and qualifications. Please contact me if you have any questions.
