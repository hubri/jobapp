My name is Big Money. I am a Automation graduate with experience in
Cloning Git Repos.

I was really excited to see this posting for Anime Expert .

I have years of experience in a wide range of
disciplines â€“ from Sub-genre labeling, to history-clearing, to cringe-suppression.

From your job posting, the position requires never turn on subtitles, praise Neon Genesis Evangelion without ever
watching it, and
only play fire-emblem characters in smash
bros., among other qualifications.

From my experience in Crunchyroll, I know like 19 different languages just like Missandrei (RIP)., just call me oregon trail, because I'm down to
bandwagon, and I know Roy's Fsmash's hitbox comes out on frame 14.

Even though, I am unfamiliar and have very limited
knowlegde of drawn once in my life, I am a quick and eager learner.

That being said, I am interested in working for industries
that make an impact in Japanese Cartoons.

With my willingness to learn and overall expertise, I
am confident that I would make me a fantastic addition
to Studio Goober.

My resume will give you a greater understanding of my
capabilities and qualifications. Please contact me if
you have any questions.
